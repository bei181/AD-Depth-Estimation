In this repository, we present a stand-alone implementation of our merging operator we use in our recent work:

## If you are an artist:

Although we are presenting few simple examples here, both low-resolution and high-resolution depth maps can be freely edited using any program before merging with our method.

Feel free to experiment and share your results with us!

## If you are a researcher developing a new (CNN-based) Monocular Depth Estimation method:

This repository is a full implementation of our double-estimation framework. Double estimation uses a base-resolution result and a high-resolution result. The optimum high-resolution for a given image, R20 resolution, depends on the receptive field size of your network (the training resolution is a good approximation) and the image content. The code for R20 computation is also provided here.

To demonstrate the high-resolution performance of your network, you can simply generate the base and high-res estimates on any dataset and use this repository to apply our double estimation method to your own work.

Our [Github repo](https://github.com/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth) for the main project also includes the implementation of our detail-focused monocular depth performance metric D^3R.



## Mix'n'match depths from different networks or use your own custom-edited ones. 
In the image below, we show that choosing a different base estimate can improve the depth for the city:
| Input | Base and details from [MiDaS][1] | Base from [LeRes][2] and details from [MiDaS][1]|
|----|------------|------------|
|![patchselection](./figures/lunch_rgb.jpg)|![patchselection](./figures/lunch_orig.png)|![patchselection](./figures/Lunch_mix.png)|

To get the optimal result for a given scene, you may want to try multiple methods in both low- and high-resolutions and pick your favourite for each case.
| Input | Base from [MiDaS v3 / DPT][3] | Base from [MiDaS v3 / DPT][3] and details from [MiDaS v2][1]|
|----|------------|------------|
|![patchselection](./figures/Motorcycle-perfect_rgb.png)|![patchselection](./figures/motorcycle_dpt_base.png)|![patchselection](./figures/motorcycle_double.png)|

Moreover, you can simply edit the base image before merging using any image editing tool for more creative control:
| Input | Base and details from [MiDaS][1] | With edited base from [MiDaS][1]|
|----|------------|------------|

## How does it work?

![merge](./figures/merge.png)

## This repository lets you combine two input depth maps with certain characteristics.

### Low-res base depth

The network uses the base estimate as the main structure of the scene. Typically this is the default-resolution result of a monocular depth estimation network at around 300x300 resolution. 

This base estimate is a good candidate for editing due to its low-resolution nature.

Monocular depth estimation methods with geometric consistency optimizations can be used as the base estimation to merge details onto a consistent base.

### High-res depth with details

The merging operation transfers the details from this high-resolution depth map onto the structure provided by the low-resolution base pair.

The high-resolution input does not need structural consistency and is typically generated by feeding the input image at a much higher resolution than the training resolution of a given monocular depth estimation network.

You can compute the optimal high-resolution estimation size for a given image using our R20 resolution calculator, also provided in this repository. You can also simply use 2x or 3x resolution to simply add more details.
